                     <p>Cast The First Stone examines the question of when is a crime really a crime and an important
                        corollary, who gets to decide. Are there, or can there be extenuating circumstances, which calls
                        the normal answer into question? Financial whiz G. Thomas Riley was a hard charger after
                        completing college. His aggression got him in some serious hot water while conducting what
                        appeared to be a routine financial audit. The client proved to be in bed with the Mob. Riley
                        caught them laundering Mob money which got him sent to prison falsely accused of appropriating
                        some of their money. After serving his sentence Riley dropped out of sight. </p>
                    <p>FBI Agent Rob Johnson is suddenly back in the community where he grew up, investigating what
                        appears to be the death of a schoolmates. Rob has a history with the victim, but hasn’t seen him
                        in a long time. A routine homicide quickly becomes far more complex as evidence is discovered.
                        With each revelation, the case turns quickly into an international manhunt for the victim’s
                        elusive partner. The partner has engaged in a most dangerous enterprise; stealing from criminal
                        organizations. It appears he has finally run afoul of the wrong man who is bent on terminating
                        him. The investigation becomes a race to locate the elusive partner before the criminals do and
                        end his life. The hunt leads Rob to a location he vowed never to revisit. </p>

                    <h2 class="col-span">Yesterday’s Shadows</h2>
                     <p>The setting for Yesterday’s Shadows is the picturesque seacoast town of Camden, Maine; renowned
                        for its active harbor, nearby mountain, and salty air. It has a colorful history in
                        shipbuilding, sailing vessels, and lobster fishing. Camden is not only scenic and peaceful, but
                        a haven for summer tourists, that is, until one of its prominent local heroes, Benjamin Scott,
                        is found murdered. His assailant is unknown and unseen. There are no witnesses and little
                        physical evidence. FBI Special Agent Rob Johnson begins to uncover Benji Scott’s secret past as
                        he investigates the murder. Rob finds himself immersed in the murky world of classified military
                        operations, a world with which he is all too familiar. Military operations, especially the world
                        of Black Ops, resemble a room full of smoke and mirrors. Finding answers is a tricky business.
                        Information is grudgingly disseminated, often hidden under layers of classification, and
                        fiercely protected by the Federal Government and the players involved. And rank has its
                        privileges. Rob must navigate this world without stepping on any landmines.</p>

                     <p>Not On My Watch follows Rob Johnson’s into civilian life after he retires from the Navy. He’s now
                        married and resides along the Maine seacoast. His life has been quiet and uneventful; actually,
                        too quiet and uneventful for an adrenalin junky who was a top Navy fighter pilot. Rob is
                        considering his options. An old acquaintance lures him into a major investigation being
                        conducted by the FBI into an act which appears to be the work of terrorists. Rob quickly becomes
                        laser-focused on the lone perpetrator who is convinced he cannot be found. Rob’s unorthodox
                        investigative methods differ greatly from the conventional FBI approach. Rob is not fooled by
                        deceptive feints. Having spent a tour on a river boat in Vietnam and flying a Navy fighter, he’s
                        well-schooled in rooting out elusive foes. But what’s behind this heinous crime? Conventional
                        wisdom seems to have taken a vacation. The perpetrator has no criminal past. Rob, though, is
                        determined not only to apprehend the man, but to learn his motive. That quest takes him on a
                        most unlikely journey. </p>

                     <p>Cast The First Stone examines the question of when is a crime really a crime and an important
                        corollary, who gets to decide. Are there, or can there be extenuating circumstances, which calls
                        the normal answer into question? Financial whiz G. Thomas Riley was a hard charger after
                        completing college. His aggression got him in some serious hot water while conducting what
                        appeared to be a routine financial audit. The client proved to be in bed with the Mob. Riley
                        caught them laundering Mob money which got him sent to prison falsely accused of appropriating
                        some of their money. After serving his sentence Riley dropped out of sight. </p>
                    <p>FBI Agent Rob Johnson is suddenly back in the community where he grew up, investigating what
                        appears to be the death of a schoolmates. Rob has a history with the victim, but hasn’t seen him
                        in a long time. A routine homicide quickly becomes far more complex as evidence is discovered.
                        With each revelation, the case turns quickly into an international manhunt for the victim’s
                        elusive partner. The partner has engaged in a most dangerous enterprise; stealing from criminal
                        organizations. It appears he has finally run afoul of the wrong man who is bent on terminating
                        him. The investigation becomes a race to locate the elusive partner before the criminals do and
                        end his life. The hunt leads Rob to a location he vowed never to revisit. </p>

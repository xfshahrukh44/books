                     <p>Not On My Watch follows Rob Johnson’s into civilian life after he retires from the Navy. He’s now
                        married and resides along the Maine seacoast. His life has been quiet and uneventful; actually,
                        too quiet and uneventful for an adrenalin junky who was a top Navy fighter pilot. Rob is
                        considering his options. An old acquaintance lures him into a major investigation being
                        conducted by the FBI into an act which appears to be the work of terrorists. Rob quickly becomes
                        laser-focused on the lone perpetrator who is convinced he cannot be found. Rob’s unorthodox
                        investigative methods differ greatly from the conventional FBI approach. Rob is not fooled by
                        deceptive feints. Having spent a tour on a river boat in Vietnam and flying a Navy fighter, he’s
                        well-schooled in rooting out elusive foes. But what’s behind this heinous crime? Conventional
                        wisdom seems to have taken a vacation. The perpetrator has no criminal past. Rob, though, is
                        determined not only to apprehend the man, but to learn his motive. That quest takes him on a
                        most unlikely journey. </p>

                     <p>The setting for Yesterday’s Shadows is the picturesque seacoast town of Camden, Maine; renowned
                        for its active harbor, nearby mountain, and salty air. It has a colorful history in
                        shipbuilding, sailing vessels, and lobster fishing. Camden is not only scenic and peaceful, but
                        a haven for summer tourists, that is, until one of its prominent local heroes, Benjamin Scott,
                        is found murdered. His assailant is unknown and unseen. There are no witnesses and little
                        physical evidence. FBI Special Agent Rob Johnson begins to uncover Benji Scott’s secret past as
                        he investigates the murder. Rob finds himself immersed in the murky world of classified military
                        operations, a world with which he is all too familiar. Military operations, especially the world
                        of Black Ops, resemble a room full of smoke and mirrors. Finding answers is a tricky business.
                        Information is grudgingly disseminated, often hidden under layers of classification, and
                        fiercely protected by the Federal Government and the players involved. And rank has its
                        privileges. Rob must navigate this world without stepping on any landmines.</p>
